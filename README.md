🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Streamlit 🌿An interactive web application that classifies Iris flowers into one of three species—Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica—based on their key physical measurements. This app uses a pre-trained machine learning model and provides real-time predictions with visual feedback.🔗 Live Demo: https://iris-classification-tyozw8vpabhfjva2yfwyvx.streamlit.app/✨ FeaturesInteractive Input: Adjust sliders to easily input and modify the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.Real-Time Prediction: Get an instant classification of the Iris species.Visual Feedback: Displays an image of the predicted species for easy identification.Model Confidence: Shows prediction probabilities for each of the three classes.🛠️ Technologies & Model Details💻 StackTechnologyPurposeStreamlitBuilding the interactive web interface and deployment.Scikit-learnMachine learning model implementation and training.Pandas & NumPyData manipulation and processing.Matplotlib/SeabornData visualization (if applicable).📊 Machine Learning ModelDataset: The classic Iris dataset (150 samples, 3 classes) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.Model: Random Forest Classifier.Accuracy: Achieves approximately 97.8% accuracy on the test set.🚀 Installation & Local UsageFollow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
cd iris-classification
2. Set Up Virtual EnvironmentIt's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.Bash# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install DependenciesInstall all necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file.Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Streamlit AppExecute the main application file. This will automatically open the app in your default web browser.Bashstreamlit run app.py
🧪 Example UsageOpen the application in your browser (via the Live Demo link or running it locally).Use the sliders on the sidebar to input new measurements for sepal and petal dimensions.View the predicted Iris species displayed prominently, along with the detailed confidence probabilities from the model.📚 AcknowledgementsDataset: The Iris dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.Inspiration: Tutorial Inspiration: Beginner’s Guide to Building an Iris Classification App with Streamlit.📄 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
