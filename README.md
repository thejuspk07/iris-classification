# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Streamlit 🌿

An interactive web application that classifies Iris flowers into one of three species—**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**—based on their key physical measurements. This app uses a pre-trained machine learning model and provides **real-time predictions** with visual feedback.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Input:** Adjust sliders to easily input and modify the **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.
* **Real-Time Prediction:** Get an instant classification of the Iris species.
* **Visual Feedback:** Displays an image of the predicted species for easy identification.
* **Model Confidence:** Shows prediction probabilities for each of the three classes.

## 🚀 Installation & Local Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git](https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git)
cd iris-classification

You're absolutely right! When you copy and paste text that uses markdown formatting (like the headings and tables I created) into plain text environments, it often loses its structure, leading to that "not in order" or jumbled look.

To ensure the structure is maintained and comes out looking like a professional README, I'll provide the final, complete markdown code block that you can copy directly and paste into your GitHub repository's README.md file.

Here is the properly structured markdown code:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git](https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git)
cd iris-classification
2. Set Up Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Streamlit App
Execute the main application file. This will automatically open the app in your default web browser.

Bash

streamlit run app.py
🧪 Example Usage
Open the application in your browser.

Use the sliders on the sidebar to input new measurements for sepal and petal dimensions.

View the predicted Iris species displayed prominently, along with the detailed confidence probabilities from the model.
